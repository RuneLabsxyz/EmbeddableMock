Start:
Adventurer wakes up confused and slowly stands up in front of the portal

Exploring:
Make the portal swirl, indicating something is about to come out of it. It has to be loopable, so I can use it as an intro before transitioning to another video.

Death:
The adventurer, tired and bruised, slowly falls to their knees, then lies down and succumbs to their injuries and dies.

Potion:
A healing potion flies out of the portal and the adventurer catches it, then proceeds to drink it

Gold:
Make a small pouch fly out of the portal and land next to the character. It should not fly around the room first, but just pop out of the portal and land
